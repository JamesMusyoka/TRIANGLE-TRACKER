##BDD
*The behaviour is how to come up with a formula that when you enter a symbol it will show you what type of triangle it is.
*Specification: Triangle Tracker Input triangle sides Check whether sides make up a triangle If a triangle is formed, the program calculates what type of triangle it is The program returns the result as an alert If a triangle is not formed, the program returns NOT A TRIANGLE
